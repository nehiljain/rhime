# Reading Habbit Improvement and Management Engine - RHIME

Problem:

1. I am not able to keep track of how many hours of my week are spent on reading.
2. I don't know if my reading helps me improve in a cohesive way. ( How are you going to compute this? )
3. I don't have a good idea of the broad category of topics I read. 
4. I want to know % completion rate of my reading.  ( How are you going to measure this? )
5. I want to know how long will reading an article take so I can plan when to read it to completion.
